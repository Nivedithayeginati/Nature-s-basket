      <h2 class="highlight">About the developer</h2>
      <img src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="Nivedtha Yeginati" class="profile-image">
      <p>A passionate student developer pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. With a strong background in web development and data analytics, I am dedicated to creating innovative, user-friendly platforms. My goal is to enhance user experiences and provide valuable solutions through technology. My experience as a Data Analyst at Cognizant has equipped me with a solid understanding of data management and analysis, which I integrate into my web development projects. The coursework at USF has significantly deepened my understanding of both fields, allowing me to merge theoretical knowledge with practical applications. This combination of skills allows me to build comprehensive, data-driven applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations. I am continually learning and adapting to new technologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

      <h2>How I Constructed the Website</h2>
      <p>I meticulously planned and designed the Nature's Basket website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. By creating wireframes and prototypes, I visualized the user flow and layout. The development process involved building key pages like Home, About Us, Manage Inventory, and Reviews, with a focus on functionality and aesthetics. JavaScript enhanced user interactions, such as the shopping cart and reviews. Rigorous testing ensured cross-browser compatibility, and the site was deployed for reliable hosting.</p>
